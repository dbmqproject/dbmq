Welcome to DBMQ documentation!
================================

Docker-based Message Queuing (DBMQ) is an efficient way to run the pre-built configurations on the build process of Dockerfiles.
Once you have finished configuring, you will be able to create your images based on your configurations.

.. note::

   DBMQ is fully stable on Linux-based distributions and there is no guarantee that this tool works as properly
   as what it does on the Linux machines on Windows machines.

Why DBMQ is Needed?
-------------------

This system locates between the user and the Docker service. You config your requirements and let this automated system to provide them to you.
You don't need to be a genius in Docker, just keep configuring.
